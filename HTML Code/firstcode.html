    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Irah Nicca Tampos who may not be the smartest, the most talented, or the most confident person in the roomâ€”but I always try my best in everything I do. Iâ€™m naturally shy and introverted, but I believe that quiet determination can still make a difference.

      What I lack in brilliance, I make up for with perseverance, patience, and the willingness to learn step by step. I value growth over perfection and effort over instant success.</p>

    <p><strong>My Goal After Graduation:</strong> After graduation, my goal is to build a career in IT where I can keep learning, improve my skills, and contribute to meaningful projectsâ€”especially in areas that can help people and make processes more efficient. Ultimately, I want to prove that even someone like me, who started with doubts and limitations, can create something valuable in the tech world.</p>
